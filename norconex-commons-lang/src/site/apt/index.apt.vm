Welcome to Norconex Commons Lang

  Norconex Commons Lang is a generic Java library containing utility classes 
  that complements the Java API and are not found in commonly available 
  libraries (such as the Apache Commons Libraries, 
  which several classes rely on).

  Amongst other things, it is used by other Norconex open-source projects.

  The current version of 
  {{{http://commons-lang.norconex.com}Norconex Commons Lang}} is 
  ${project.version}

  The following is a general description of packages 
  available in this library.  Click on a package links to 
  get a summary of classes and complete documentation:

* Configuration

  Makes it easier to deal with configuration files and configurable classes,
  especially when dealing with XML.
  Their purpose is to make configuration files more portable, reusable
  and manageable.  Turn your configuration files into templates that can
  interpret variables defined in variables files and can include 
  reusable configuration fragments.

* I/O

  Provides features for dealing with streams, files and directories,
  such as:
  
    * getting the "head" or the "tail" of a file

    * create time-based directory structure

    * recursively browse directories using the visitor pattern

    * filter input streams using input stream filters (e.g. regex-based filter)

    * stream a file in reverse

    * create listeners that get notified when input stream is being read

  Classes: {{{./apidocs/com/norconex/commons/lang/io/package-summary.html} com.norconex.commons.lang.io.*}}
