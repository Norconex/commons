TODO:
==============

- Add XML.getValue(String xpath, Class<T> type) and use Convert 
  for conversion.  Remove getXXX Methods?  Do same with Set if not done already.
  
- Same as above, but for Properties

- Make method naming more consistent between Properties and XML.   

- Overload load/store methods to accept a Path 

- Make Properties and XML take a IConverter as constructor agreement, but 
  default to Converter static instance.

- Maybe: See if we can have getElement() use return type of assigned variable
  to determine how to create the object instead of having getXXX methods?

- Have option to not do validation on loading of dom, in case a consuming
  class wants to modify the DOM before validation.

- EnhancedXMLStreamWriter: eliminate concept of "writeBlanks" and always 
  write them for elements with text only (and attributes?)?

- Is Pipeline really needed with Java 8. Could functional interfaces do it?

- Replace/refactor process execution to use new process features of Java 8.

- See if we eliminate JEF, have more options in this lib.

- Remove all @since 1.x???

- Remove all classes that are already part of Apache Commons.

- Reduce dependencies wherever possible.

- Redo website so it looks closer to collectors?

- Redo download page so we no longer need to have a "currentRelease" property
  in pom.xml

- Consider using Apache Commons Exec to replace SystemCommand? -- NO: Java 8

- Allows to specify a velocity-tools.properties or equivalent in classpath
  root (e.g. classes/ folder) to define custom classes/tools to be used 
  by Velocity.

- Modify Jar copier to handle cases where snapshot are timestamped instead and
  not being considered the latest when they should.  Like:
  norconex-commons-lang-1.13.0-20170328.184247-17.jar vs 
  norconex-commons-lang-1.13.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
